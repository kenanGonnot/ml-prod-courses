# MLOps - Specialization Machine Learning Engineering for Production 

* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops#faq) by Andrew Ng

***
#### What I learned: 
* Design an ML production system end-to-end: project scoping, data needs, modeling strategies, and deployment requirements.
* Establish a model baseline, address concept drift, and prototype how to develop, deploy, and continuously improve a productionized ML application.
* Build data pipelines by gathering, cleaning, and validating datasets. Establish data lifecycle by using data lineage and provenance metadata tools.
* Apply best practices and progressive delivery techniques to maintain and monitor a continuously operating production system.
